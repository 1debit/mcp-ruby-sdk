description: Updating CHANGELOG.md before cutting a new release of the gem
globs: CHANGELOG.md

- start by refreshing your knowledge on the Keep a Changelog convention by reading the format spec referenced at the top of CHANGELOG.md
- stick to Keep a Changelog
- entries should be terse and in a top-level flat list: do not nest
- follow this format for entries:
  - Terse description of the change (#nnn)
- git tags are used to mark the commit that cut a new release of the gem
- the gem version is located in [version.rb](mdc:lib/mcp/version.rb)
- use the git history, especially merge commits from PRs to construct the changelog
- when necessary, look at the diff of files changed to determine the true nature of the change
- maintenance PRs that don't concern end users of the gem should not be listed in the changelog
- when checking PRs, see if there's an upstream remote, and if so, fetch PRs from upstream instead of origin

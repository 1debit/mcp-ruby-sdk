- output the changelog as markdown when asked. 
- git tags are used to mark the commit that cut a new release of the gem
- the gem version is located in [version.rb](mdc:lib/model_context_protocol/version.rb)
- use the git history, especially merge commits from PRs to construct the changelog
- when necessary, look at the diff of files changed to determine whether a PR should be listed in 
  - ## Added; adds new functionality
  - ## Changed; alters functionality; especially backward compatible changes
  - ## Fixed; bugfixes that are forward compatible
